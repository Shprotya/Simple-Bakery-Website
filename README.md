# Simple-Bakery-Website
A static website built with HTML and CSS as one of my early web development projects. The goal was to practice layout structure, custom fonts, background images, basic navigation, and embedding external content such as Google Maps. This project helped me understand how real websites are structured and styled from scratch.
